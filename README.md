# lab_assignment_6
Write an efficient recursive function that takes in a sorted array of numbers, two integers, low and high, representing indexes into the array, and another integer, value, and returns the index in the array where value is found in the array in between index low and high, inclusive. If value is NOT found in the array in between indexes low and high, inclusive, then the function should return -1. 

# Student note 1
For some reason, my code wouldn't work in VS code, and would return the same number, 32759, instead of any of the prompts, over and over and over again. I had to use an online compiler to check my work. 

# Student note 2
For the grading criteria "Low==High case returning mid", in every way did not work on the code, however an else statement returning the mid did work, so I went with that. The low == high case isn't always true when you need to return mid.
