# lab_assignment_6
Write an efficient recursive function that takes in a sorted array of numbers, two integers, low and high, representing indexes into the array, and another integer, value, and returns the index in the array where value is found in the array in between index low and high, inclusive. If value is NOT found in the array in between indexes low and high, inclusive, then the function should return -1.

For some reason, my code wouldn't work in VS code, and would return the same number, 32759, instead of any of the prompts, over and over and over again. I had to use an online compiler to check my work.
